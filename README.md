# Note Taker

[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org)

## Description

This project is aimed to create an app to develop a note taker for a user to keep track of tasks ranging from simple to important or complex. This takes weight off of the user of having to remember everything from small chores to important deadlines. The challenge of this project was creating server files that will take requests from the client, handle that request appropriately and send the response back to the client to be rendered or notify the user that some action has taken place. Another challenge faced was getting the application deployed through Heroku. Due to the nature of the application being dynamic, GitHub pages won't be showing all of the functionality of our backend code. Below are screenshots of the deployed application which can be found [here](https://stark-chamber-55940-5c95074902c3.herokuapp.com/).

Once on the notes page, you will be able to type in a note header and add extra notes. Once you have filled in both text input fields, a save icon will appear in the top right corner of the app next to the "+". Once saved, the note will appear on the left column. You can interact with past notes by either deleting it or if you click the text of the note, it will jump the note back to the right and enlarge it. If a previous note is enlarged and you wish to enter in a new note, hit the "+" button at the top right to clear out the old note that's expanded and you will be able to write a new note.
